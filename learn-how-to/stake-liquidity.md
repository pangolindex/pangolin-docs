# ♒ Providing Liquidity

Pangolin allows token holders to add liquidity to pools. By adding liquidity, you receive PGL tokens, which is a representation of your ownership of the pool. After adding liquidity to a pool, you will see how you can use those PGL tokens to earn PNG.

{% hint style="info" %}
You may only receive PNG rewards from supported pools, which can be found under the following section on the Litepaper: Community - Liquidity Mining Allocation (95% of PNG)
{% endhint %}

### Add Liquidity&#x20;

Pangolin allows Liquidity Providers (LPs) with Avalanche and Ethereum tokens to deposit them and earn yield from exchange fees. LPs can create a new liquidity pool or add liquidity to an existing one. LPs will earn at least 0.25% of all trades on the deposited token pair proportional to the share of the pool. Fees are added to the pool and accrue in real-time. Each pool has its own return, which is determined by a function.

### **Option 1: Create a New Liquidity Pool**

If a token pair doesn’t exist, you must create a new liquidity pool. The price of the tokens will be determined by the ratio of what you deposit. For example, if you deposit 1 PNG and 5 DAI into this new liquidity pool, there will be an initial price of 5 DAI per PNG or 0.2 PNG per DAI. These prices are dynamic and will change as liquidity is added or removed and the ratio of the pool adjusts.

1. Determine the ratio of the new liquidity pool by inputting the amounts you will deposit for each token
2. Select "**Supply**"
3. Select "**Create Pool & Supply**"

4\. **Confirm **the transaction and finalize the transaction.

### Option 2: Add to an Existing Liquidity Pool

1\. Select "**Pool" **in the Menu&#x20;

2\. Select "**Add Liquidity"**

3\. Choose the token you would like to add to the liquidity pool

Let’s say you choose AVAX as the token you would like to deposit. Once you choose AVAX, it will ask you to decide on the token pair you would like to enter, which is the liquidity pool. When you choose that token pair, it will require you to add an equivalent value of that token pair

a. Choose the **token**, and enter the **amount **you would like to **deposit**

b. Choose the **token pair **you would like to **deposit **

{% hint style="success" %}
Example: In this case, we want to deposit 1 AVAX. This will result in us having to deposit an equivalent value of PNG tokens, which at the current rate is 28.3791 PNG tokens.

c. Select "**Confirm Supply**" and **confirm **the transaction on MetaMask

## Managing your Liquidity Pools

Once you create a new liquidity pool or add to an existing one, you will automatically have your position visible, allowing you to manage the liquidity pool by adding or removing liquidity

![](../.gitbook/assets/liq7.png)

You may view details about your position when you click on the "**Manage**" dropdown.

Here are four stats that give information about your position:

1. Your pool tokens: tokens issued to you that represent your position in the liquidity pool
2. Pooled Token #1
3. Pooled Token #2
4. Your pool share: the percentage of the liquidity pool that your deposited tokens represent

### **Removing Liquidity from your Liquidity Pools**

1. Select "**Manage**"
2. Select "**Remove**"
3. Determine the number of your tokens that you want to remove from the liquidity pool. In this case, we chose 100%

![](../.gitbook/assets/liq9.png)

4\. Select "**Remove**"

5\. Select "**Confirm**," and confirm the transaction on MetaMask

### **Adding Liquidity to your Liquidity Pools**

If you would like to add more liquidity to your existing liquidity pool, you may do so with the following steps

1\. Select "**Manage**"

![](../.gitbook/assets/liq11.png)

2\. Select "**Add**"

![](../.gitbook/assets/liq12.png)

3\. Determine the number of tokens you would like to add to the liquidity pool. In this case, we chose to add 1 PNG token, which means we have to add an equal amount of AVAX

![](../.gitbook/assets/liq13.png)

4\. Select "**Supply**"

5\. Select "**Confirm Supply**" and confirm the transaction on MetaMask
