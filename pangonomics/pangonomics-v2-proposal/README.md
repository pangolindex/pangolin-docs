# ðŸ“Œ Pangonomics V2 Proposal

[https://gov.pangolin.exchange/t/pangolin-tokenomics-improvement-proposal/1807](https://gov.pangolin.exchange/t/pangolin-tokenomics-improvement-proposal/1807)

### Overview

This proposal is to improve the underlying tokenomics of the PNG token. Some of the reasoning behind the proposal:

* 28 years token emission schedule is excessive for a DeFi protocol
* No foundation allocation puts the sustainability of Pangolinâ€™s future at risk
* Improve our PNG rewards distribution to be more dynamic and competitive

We hope to achieve this by doing the following:

* Moving to a (retroactive) four year emissions schedule for PNG
* Allocate a percent of the supply to a Foundation

Goals:

1. Gradually reducing emission schedule
2. Fund the treasury to reach 30M PNG
3. Provide attractive APRs in the first year to stay competitive
4. Deflationary measures (burns)

If we look at the current supply and allocation of 538 million:\

We will move to 230 million PNG (**a 57% reduction in PNG tokens**):

New Max Supply: 230M\
Treasury Goal: 30M (13% of max supply), with 6M of the 30M set aside for the Team Fund

Duration: 4 years

### How do we propose to achieve this?

Our proposed Emissions Schedule will look similar to the below:

| Month | Monthly Reduction | PNG/day emitted | PNG/day diverted | Total Emitted | Total Diverted | Total In Treasury | Total Burned | Total Supply |

## How will this occur?

* An on chain governance proposal will be loaded (tentatively scheduled for 11th October 2021)
* If the on chain proposal passes, then the emissions schedule as proposed above will be implemented
* New [universal guidelines 34](new-reward-guidelines.md) for the new PNG distribution will be loaded
* We will code a Proxy contract. Our current [Vesting contract 11](https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/address/0x6747AC215dAFfeE03a42F49FebB6ab448E12acEe/transactions) will then push all PNG emissions to this Proxy contract
* The Proxy contract will then divert some PNG to the Foundation and the rest of the PNG to a new LiquidityPool contract. All PNG emitted after the 4 years elapses will be burnt.
* We havenâ€™t finalised the design of the new LiquidityPool contract, but are currently investigating whether a variant of MasterChef or a new contract will make more sense logistically
* These contracts will then be audited by Halborn
