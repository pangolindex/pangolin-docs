# Introduction to Pangolin

![](.gitbook/assets/logo.svg)

## Why Pangolin?

Pangolin is a decentralized exchange \(DEX\) which runs on Avalanche, uses the same automated market-making \(AMM\) model as [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works), features a native governance token called **PNG** that is fully community distributed and is capable of trading all tokens issued on Ethereum and Avalanche. In a crowded marketplace with multiple contenders, Pangolin offers three critically important benefits: **fast and cheap trades**, **community-driven development**, and a **fair and open token distribution**.

**First**, Pangolin can finalize trades quickly and cheaply. Since Pangolin is built on Avalanche, it enables users to swap assets while enjoying **sub-second transaction finality** and transaction **fees as low as a few cents**. Oftentimes, trades on Pangolin will feel as fast as trades on centralized exchanges. 

**Second**, beyond the significant performance upgrades to the technical status quo, Pangolin is **community-driven**. The native **governance** token, **PNG**, enables the community to **drive the development** of the product in full. 

**Third**, but not least, Pangolin features a **100% community-focused token distribution** model, meaning that all tokens are distributed directly to the community, without any allocations to team, advisors, investors, or insiders.

## Governance / Vote üó≥ 

**PNG** tokens represent voting shares in Pangolin governance. You can vote on each proposal yourself or delegate your votes to a third party. To be eligible to vote, you **must hold PNG** in your wallet and delegate it at the start of voting. After voting has begun, you may pool or spend your PNG. Governance votes are decided by simple majority. There is no quorum threshold.
