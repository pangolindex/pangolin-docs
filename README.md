## About Pangolin

Pangolin is a decentralized exchange (DEX) which runs on Avalanche, uses the same automated market-making (AMM) model as [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works), features a native governance token called **PNG **that is fully community distributed and is capable of trading all tokens issued on Ethereum and Avalanche. In a crowded marketplace with multiple contenders, Pangolin offers three critically important benefits: **fast and cheap trades**, **community-driven development**, and a **fair and open token distribution**.

**First**, Pangolin can finalize trades quickly and cheaply. Since Pangolin is built on Avalanche, it enables users to swap assets while enjoying **sub-second transaction finality** and transaction **fees as low as a few cents**. Oftentimes, trades on Pangolin will feel as fast as trades on centralized exchanges.&#x20;

**Second**, beyond the significant performance upgrades to the technical status quo, Pangolin is **community-driven**. The native **governance **token, **PNG**, enables the community to **drive the development** of the product in full.&#x20;

**Third**, but not least, Pangolin features a **100% community-focused token distribution** model, meaning that all tokens are distributed directly to the community, without any allocations to team, advisors, investors, or insiders.
