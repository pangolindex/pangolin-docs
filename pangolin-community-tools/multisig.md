**Please note:** If you look at the above, you'll see the ABI string is there. This ABI can be gotten from the C Chain explorer. So if you look here [https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/address/0x912b5D41656048Ef681eFa9D32488a3fFE397994/contracts](https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/address/0x912b5D41656048Ef681eFa9D32488a3fFE397994/contracts) You'll be able to copy the ABI and paste it in the transaction menu and you'll then get access to all the methods.
