# Security

{% hint style="success" %}
**Pangolin** is one of the safest protocols on **Avalanche**: Forked from Uniswap V2 and every new deployed contract is audited by **Halborn**
{% endhint %}

## Audits & Formal Verification

### Uniswap V2 Audit Report

From January 8th to April 30th 2020, a team of six engineers reviewed and formally verified crucial components of the smart contracts for the second version of the Uniswap decentralized trading protocol.

## Audits by Halborn

Halborn used automated testing techniques to enhance coverage of certain areas of the scoped contract. Among the tools used was Slither, a Solidity static analysis framework. After Halborn verified all the contracts in the repository and was able to compile them correctly into their abi and binary formats. This tool can statically verify mathematical relationships between Solidity variables to detect invalid or inconsistent usage of the contractsâ€™ APIs across the entire code-base.
