If you decide to increase the amount you want to swap in an inefficient pool, a warning will indicate that you are about to swap at an unfavorable rate. To avoid this, simply lower the amount you want to swap or wait for the pool to increase in liquidity.

### Interface Settings

With interface settings, you can adjust slippage, transaction timeouts, and the interface from light to dark mode. In the top right corner, there is a cog wheel that gives you the option to change these settings.

### Transaction Settings

Slippage tolerance: set limits on how much you are willing to let the price change for the swap. If it falls out of the limit, the transaction is canceled.
